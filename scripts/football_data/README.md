# Football-Data.co.uk Integration System

This module provides comprehensive integration with football-data.co.uk, offering 30+ years of Premier League historical data and automated weekly updates.

## üìä Overview

The football-data.co.uk system provides rich Premier League match data including:
- **Match Results**: Full-time and half-time scores, match outcomes
- **Team Statistics**: Shots (total/on target), corners, cards, fouls for both teams  
- **Official Information**: Referee assignments for each match
- **Betting Markets**: Comprehensive odds from major bookmakers (Bet365, William Hill, etc.)
- **Advanced Markets**: Over/under goals, Asian handicap, correct score odds

## üóÉÔ∏è Historical Data Coverage

- **Time Period**: 1993/94 to current season (32 complete seasons)
- **Total Matches**: 12,324 historical Premier League matches (100% coverage)
- **Team Coverage**: All 51 historical Premier League teams mapped
- **Data Completeness**: Complete match coverage across all eras

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

### `migrate_legacy_data.py`
Imports historical Premier League data from the legacy football_data.db into the main database.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test migration (recommended first run)
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/migrate_legacy_data.py --test

# Force migration (overwrites existing data)
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/migrate_legacy_data.py --force

# Production migration
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/migrate_legacy_data.py
```

**Features:**
- Imports all 12,324 historical matches from legacy database (100% coverage)
- Maps all 51 historical Premier League teams to database teams
- Creates comprehensive indexes for optimal performance
- Handles SQL reserved words (AS column) properly
- Updates teams.football_data_name column for future reference
- Transaction safety with rollback on errors

### `fetch_football_data.py`
Downloads current season Premier League data from football-data.co.uk and updates the database.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test with existing sample data
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/fetch_football_data.py --test

# Dry run (show what would be done)
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/fetch_football_data.py --dry-run

# Production run (actual data download and database update)
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/fetch_football_data.py
```

**Features:**
- Downloads current season CSV from https://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2526/E0.csv
- Updates existing matches with latest statistics and odds
- Inserts new matches as they become available
- Converts date formats (DD/MM/YYYY ‚Üí YYYY-MM-DD)
- Maps team names using database team mappings
- Sample data management with automatic cleanup
- Change detection to avoid unnecessary database updates

## üîÑ Scheduler Integration

The system integrates with the master scheduler for automated operation:

**Configuration:** `scripts/scheduler/scheduler_config.conf`
```bash
# Enable football-data collection
ENABLE_FETCH_FOOTBALL_DATA=true
```

**Schedule:** Weekly on Sundays at 9:00 AM
```bash
# Weekly on Sundays at 9 AM (Football-data.co.uk data collection)
if [[ $(date +%u) -eq 7 ]] && [[ $current_hour -eq 9 ]] && [[ $current_minute -eq 0 ]]; then
    if [[ "$ENABLE_FETCH_FOOTBALL_DATA" == "true" ]]; then
        run_script "scripts/football_data/fetch_football_data.py" "fetch_football_data" &
        log "DEBUG" "Triggered fetch_football_data (weekly Sunday 9 AM)"
    fi
fi
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

### New Tables
- **`football_stats`**: Main table with 192 columns containing all historical and current match data

### Enhanced Tables
- **`teams`**: New `football_data_name` column for team name mapping

### Team Name Mapping
The system automatically maps football-data.co.uk team names to database team names:

| Football-Data Name | Database Name |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Arsenal | arsenal |
| Man United | man utd |
| Man City | man city |
| Nott'm Forest | nott'm forest |
| Tottenham | spurs |
| West Ham | west ham |

## üìÅ Sample Data Management

Both scripts include intelligent sample data management:

**Location:** `samples/football_data/`
**Pattern:** `football_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
**Retention:** 5 files (configurable)
**Cleanup:** Automatic removal of old files

## üîß Testing

### Migration Testing
```bash
# Test migration with detailed output
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/migrate_legacy_data.py --test --force

# Verify migration results
sqlite3 data/database.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM football_stats"
sqlite3 data/database.db "SELECT DISTINCT Season FROM football_stats ORDER BY Season"
```

### Weekly Fetch Testing
```bash
# Test with sample data (no internet required)
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/fetch_football_data.py --test

# Test download without database changes
./venv/bin/python scripts/football_data/fetch_football_data.py --dry-run

# Verify current season data
sqlite3 data/database.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM football_stats WHERE Season = '25/26'"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Migration fails with "table football_stats has X columns but Y values were supplied"**
- Cause: Column count mismatch between source and destination
- Solution: The script now uses dynamic schema copying to handle this automatically

**2. SQL syntax error: near "AS"**
- Cause: AS is a reserved word in SQLite
- Solution: Column is now properly quoted as [AS] in SQL queries

**3. Team mapping failures**
- Cause: Historical teams not in current database
- Expected: Historical teams like "Birmingham", "Bolton" will be skipped
- Current teams: 27 teams successfully mapped, others appropriately skipped

**4. No sample files found in test mode**
- Cause: No previous downloads available for testing
- Solution: Run once without --test flag to download sample, then use --test

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check total matches by season
SELECT Season, COUNT(*) FROM football_stats GROUP BY Season ORDER BY Season;

-- Check current season progress
SELECT Date, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG, FTR 
FROM football_stats 
WHERE Season = '25/26' 
ORDER BY Date DESC;

-- Verify team mappings
SELECT team_name, football_data_name 
FROM teams 
WHERE football_data_name IS NOT NULL;

-- Check data completeness
SELECT Season, 
       COUNT(*) as matches,
       COUNT(FTHG) as with_scores,
       COUNT(Referee) as with_referee,
       COUNT(B365H) as with_odds
FROM football_stats 
GROUP BY Season 
ORDER BY Season DESC;
```

## üìà Data Quality
