  - **Web Dashboard Integration**: Recommendation widget with current season stats and switch timing guidance
  - **Adaptive Strategy Tab**: New "ðŸŽ¯ Recommended" strategy that dynamically switches between 1-0 and 2-1 predictions
  - **Performance Tracking**: Expected points improvement calculations (+0.05 pts/game for current season)

- **Enhanced Predictions Dashboard** - Major upgrade to prediction analysis capabilities
  - **7 Strategy Options**: Fixed (2-1, 2-0, 1-0), Adaptive, Calibrated, Home/Away Bias, Poisson, Smart Goals, Custom
  - **Season Recommendation Widget**: Prominent dashboard showing current analysis and switch guidance
  - **Historical Context Display**: Shows similar seasons and their optimal strategies
  - **Interactive Strategy Comparison**: Real-time performance metrics across all strategies
  - **Backend Strategy Logic**: Enhanced `generate_prediction_for_fixture()` with adaptive strategy support

- **ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Automated Predictions** - Refactored automated predictions to use AI-driven strategy recommendations
  - **Adaptive Strategy Integration**: Replaces fixed 2-1 strategy with intelligent season-based recommendations
  - **Real-Time Strategy Selection**: Automatically uses 1-0 strategy for current season (53.3% low-scoring matches)
  - **Fallback Protection**: Gracefully defaults to 2-1 strategy if recommendation system unavailable
  - **Enhanced Logging**: Clear indication of strategy selection and reasoning in output
  - **Expected Performance**: +0.05 pts/game improvement over fixed 2-1 approach
  - **Seamless Integration**: No changes to scheduling, Dropbox uploads, or notification systems

- **Automated Predictions Gameweek Integration** - Enhanced automated predictions to write to main gameweek predictions files
  - **Dual File Creation**: Predictions now automatically appended to both `/predictions_league/odds-api/predictions{gameweek}.txt` and `/predictions_league/Predictions/2025_26/gameweek{gameweek}.txt`
  - **Append/Create Logic**: If gameweek file exists, predictions are appended; if not, new file is created
  - **Dropbox API Integration**: Uses Dropbox download/upload API to read existing content and combine with new predictions
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when one location fails, continues if at least one upload succeeds
  - **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logging shows success/failure status for both upload locations

- **Automated Predictions Force Mode** - Added CLI arguments to bypass all safety checks for testing and emergency use
  - **Force Flag**: `--force` bypasses deadline, file existence, and recent processing checks
  - **Gameweek Override**: `--gameweek N` allows forcing specific gameweek (requires --force)
  - **Safety Validation**: Prevents `--gameweek` usage without `--force` flag
  - **Complete Logging**: All force mode actions clearly logged with proper file-based logging
  - **Strategy Preservation**: Force mode still uses intelligent 1-0 strategy from database
  - **Use Cases**: Development testing, emergency prediction generation, historical analysis

- **Enhanced Logging System** - Upgraded automated_predictions.py from print-based to proper file logging
  - **File-Based Logs**: Creates `logs/automated_predictions_YYYYMMDD.log` files
  - **Dual Output**: Logs to both file and console for monitoring
  - **Proper Log Levels**: INFO, WARNING, ERROR levels with timestamps
  - **Project Consistency**: Follows established logging patterns from other scripts

### Fixed
- **Database Upload Timestamp Logic** - Simplified and improved `monitor_and_upload.py` timestamp update logic
  - **Issue**: Complex prepare/rollback system was unnecessary and could lead to inconsistent states
  - **Impact**: Upload timestamps might be updated before upload completed, causing potential tracking issues
  - **Solution**: Simplified to only update `last_update` table **after** successful uploads
  - **Removed**: `prepare_upload_timestamp()` and `rollback_upload_timestamp()` functions
  - **Added**: Single `update_upload_timestamp()` function that runs only after successful upload
  - **Result**: Clean flow - upload â†’ verify success â†’ update timestamp; no updates if upload fails or doesn't occur
  - **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive status indicators showing exactly when/why uploads occur or are skipped

- **Season Recommendations Database Update** - Fixed `update_season_recommendations.py` not populating the "updated" column in last_update table
  - **Issue**: Script was only inserting into `table_name` and `timestamp` columns, ignoring the `updated` column
  - **Impact**: Database upload monitoring couldn't detect season recommendation changes
  - **Solution**: Modified `update_last_update_table()` to populate all three columns: `table_name`, `updated` (ISO format), and `timestamp` (Unix timestamp)
  - **Result**: Season recommendation updates now properly trigger automated database uploads

- **Keys.json Permission Preservation** - Fixed scripts that were resetting file permissions during token updates
  - **Issue**: `clean_predictions_dropbox.py` and `setup_dropbox_oauth.py` were changing keys.json permissions to 0600 (owner-only) when refreshing Dropbox tokens
  - **Impact**: Broke group read access for `predictionleague` group on production servers
  - **Solution**: Modified both scripts to preserve original file permissions and ownership after atomic file updates
  - **Implementation**: Added `os.stat()` capture before `shutil.move()` and `os.chmod()`/`os.chown()` restoration after
  - **Files Modified**: `scripts/prediction_league/clean_predictions_dropbox.py`, `scripts/prediction_league/setup_dropbox_oauth.py`
  - **Production Ready**: Scripts now maintain 640 permissions (owner rw, group r) for multi-user access

- **JavaScript Syntax Errors in Predictions Template** - Fixed critical syntax errors preventing predictions page from loading
  - **Issue**: Used Python-style docstrings (`"""`) in JavaScript functions causing "Unexpected string" errors
  - **Solution**: Replaced Python docstrings with proper JavaScript comments (`//`) in all recommendation functions
  - **Affected Functions**: `loadSeasonRecommendation()`, `updateRecommendationWidget()`, `getConfidenceColor()`, `hideRecommendationWidget()`, `updateAdaptiveStrategyDescription()`
  - **Result**: Predictions page now loads correctly with functional recommendation widget and adaptive strategy

- **Timezone Display** - Fixed deadline time display in automated predictions notifications
  - **Issue**: Deadline times were showing in UTC instead of local UK time
  - **Solution**: Added pytz dependency and proper timezone conversion using `Europe/London` timezone
  - **Result**: Pushover notifications now display correct London time (handles BST/GMT automatically)
  - **Implementation**: `create_fixtures_string()` function now converts UTC timestamps to London time

### Changed
- **Automated Predictions** - Updated fixture notification timing from 1 hour to 24 hour cooldown
  - **Improvement**: Reduced notification frequency while maintaining timely fixture delivery
  - **Logic**: Fixtures are less time-sensitive than predictions, 24-hour spacing prevents spam
  - **Context**: Script still only runs when deadline is within 36 hours
